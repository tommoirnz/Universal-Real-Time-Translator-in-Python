Real-Time Language Translator – User Manual
The Real-Time Language Translator is a powerful tool designed for seamless language translation. It processes live speech or text input, translates it between languages, and even vocalizes the translation using text-to-speech (TTS). This manual explains all the features so you can get the most out of the program.

1. Getting Started
A. Installation and Launch
Requirements:
Ensure you have Python installed along with all necessary packages (e.g., tkinter, speech_recognition, deep_translator, edge_tts, pydub, etc.).
Starting the Application:
Run the main program file (commonly named main.py) using your preferred Python IDE or from the command line.
2. Main Window Overview
When you launch the program, the main window appears with several control panels:

A. Language and Device Configuration
Language Selection Dropdowns:
Spoken Language: Select the language you will speak.
Target Translation Language: Choose the language into which your speech or text will be translated.
Swap Languages Button: Quickly swap the spoken and target languages if needed.
Microphone Device Selection:
A dropdown lists available audio input devices (e.g., built-in or external microphones). Choose the correct device for best results.
B. Audio Capture Settings
Mic Gain Slider:
Adjust the sensitivity of your microphone. The slider is aligned with other audio settings for consistent placement.
Buffer Size Slider:
Controls how many audio chunks are accumulated before processing. Adjusting this can help optimize real-time recognition.
Overlap Slider:
Sets the percentage of overlap between successive audio buffers to reduce missed words.
C. Control Buttons (Located in the Bottom Frame)
Start/Stop Audio Capture:
Toggles live audio capture. When started, the app listens for speech, converts it into text, translates it, and (if enabled) vocalizes the translation.
Flush Buffers:
Clears all internal buffers (audio and message queues) to reset the session.
Read File:
Opens a new window that allows you to load text files or EPUB eBooks for translation.
Enter Text:
Opens a manual text input window for typing or pasting text directly.
D. Display Areas
Recognized Text Display:
A text box on the left side of the main window displays the live speech converted into text.
Translation Window:
A separate window shows the translated output and includes additional options for TTS and display customization.
3. Translation Window and TTS Options
The translation window not only displays the translated text but also provides controls to fine-tune the output:

A. Text-to-Speech (TTS) Controls
Enable TTS Checkbox:
Turn TTS on or off. When enabled, the application will speak the translated text.
TTS Output Device Selection:
Choose which audio output device should play the TTS audio. The default device is used unless changed.
Voice Selection Dropdown:
Pick from a list of available voices (which include country information) for the TTS service.
TTS Speech Rate Slider:
Adjust the speaking rate. Moving the slider above 100% speeds up the speech, while below 100% slows it down.
B. Display and Batch Translation Options
Translated Text Font Size Slider:
Adjust the font size of the translated text for easier reading.
Batch Translation Button:
Initiates batch processing for long texts or documents. A progress window displays translation progress for the entire document.
Save Output Button:
Saves the translated text to a file.
Clear Screen Button:
Clears the translated text area.
4. Text Input Features
The application supports several methods to input text for translation:

A. Manual Text Entry
Enter Text Window:
Clicking the Enter Text button opens a window with a text box. You can type directly into the box or use the Paste button to insert text from your clipboard.
Paste Functionality:
The Paste button allows you to quickly paste any copied text into the text box for translation.
Submit, Pause, and Resume:
Once you’ve entered text, click Submit to begin translation. You can pause the reading/translation process if you need to review or edit the text, then resume when ready.
B. File and eBook Input
Read File Window (Listbox Mode):
By clicking the Read File button, a new window opens where you can:
Click Load File to select a text file (.txt) or an EPUB eBook.
The file's contents are automatically split into segments. For EPUB files, the program extracts text from the ebook structure.
The segmented text is displayed in a listbox.
Navigating Segments:
A slider is available to navigate through the different segments of the loaded document.
Starting Translation from File:
Click Begin to start processing and translating the loaded text.
5. Live Speech Translation
For real-time translation, follow these steps:

Set Up Your Environment:
Choose your spoken language and target translation language from the dropdown menus. Also, select the appropriate microphone device.
Adjust Audio Settings:
Use the Mic Gain, Buffer Size, and Overlap sliders to optimize audio capture based on your environment.
Start Audio Capture:
Click Start Audio Capture. The application will begin to listen, recognize your speech, translate it, and (if enabled) speak the translation.
Live Feedback:
The recognized text is shown in the main window, and the translation is displayed (and optionally vocalized) in the translation window.
Stop Audio Capture:
Click the same button (now labeled Stop Audio Capture) to end live processing.
6. Additional Features
A. Saving and Managing Transcripts
Save Transcript:
In the main window, use the Save Transcript button to store both the recognized speech and translated text into a file for later reference.
B. Minimizing to the System Tray
Minimize to Tray:
Click the Minimize to Tray button to hide the main window while the program continues running in the background. You can restore the window later by interacting with the system tray icon.
C. Robust Error Handling and Logging
Network and DNS Issues:
If the program is unable to resolve domains (e.g., "translate.google.com"), it logs the error and will retry. Make sure you have a stable internet connection.
Internal Logging:
Detailed logging is implemented to help diagnose errors such as speech recognition failures, TTS issues, or file loading errors. Check the log file (located in your home directory) for troubleshooting details.
7. Tips for Optimal Use
Internet Connection:
A reliable internet connection is essential since the translation and speech recognition services rely on external APIs.
Audio Settings:
Experiment with the Buffer Size and Overlap sliders to best capture your speech, especially in noisy environments.
Use Batch Translation for Documents:
For long documents, use the batch translation feature to process and translate the entire text efficiently.
Take Advantage of Multiple Input Methods:
Whether you prefer speaking, typing, pasting text, or loading an ebook, the application supports all these input methods so you can choose the one that suits your needs best.
