So for example French to English. If you require the translation spoken you must enable the spoken text to speech and select a suitable voice. You may have to load the foreign voice on your PC.
If you use say an English voice on an English to French translation it will come out all Franglais which can be quite amusing!
You can save a transcript of the translation in text afterwards. It has a buffer, best not to change it to begin with. Make it bigger and the delay becomes longer (latency).
It uses Google deep learning and translation in Python. It is modelled a bit on Star Trek Universal translator but so far the auto detect language doesn't work that well
so I had to put up with defining the source and destination languages. It is a bit like some apps for phones but runs on a PC continuously.
You don't have to wait and then press a button to translate. You might want to use earphones if you are using a microphone otherwise with an external mic it hears itself 
and you get an echo around effect where it keeps repeating itself!
